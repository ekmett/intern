synopsis:      Efficient hash-consing for arbitrary data types
description:
    Changes from 0.8 to 0.9
    .
    * Removed 'identity' from the Interned class, to support applications where the identity is obtained by other means (e.g. a unique Ptr value)
    .
    Changes from 0.7 to 0.8
    .
    * Disabled cache removal as it was causing problems on large data sets. There is no good way to ensure that both references remain alive long enough to finish comparisons.
    * Switched to IORef from MVar
    .
    Changes from 0.6 to 0.7
    .
    * Fixed problem where comparisons could happen between data structures while one was still a thunk, leading to equal structures comparing as inequal in limited circumstances, by appropriately using strictness annotations.
    .
    Efficient hash-consing for arbitrary data types
    .
    Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.6
    .
    * Widened the caches so they don't go through a single MVar per type. This has made a dramatic impact on performance. However, this broke the previous invariant that newer entries always had higher Ids than older entries.
    .
    Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2
    .
    * Added Data.Interned.IntSet
